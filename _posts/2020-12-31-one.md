title: I welcome myself to Github pages
---

Thanks to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), I am able to host my own static 
website on Github at no cost. Jekyll is quite easy. Previously, I had to write 
my blogs in plain HTML, add CSS to it and host it on my computer but now with 
Jekyll, I can write my blogs in markdown and push it to Github in a few seconds.
