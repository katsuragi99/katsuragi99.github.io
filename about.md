Hello, You can call me Katsuragi. I'm a developer specializing in Rust, C++, 
C and Python. There isn't much to say about me. I code, learn and push to git 
all day.


## Metadata of my computer

- I use a Dell Inspiron laptop as my primary computer. It runs Debian stable.
- I have a Raspberry Pi Zero W which runs talkers, IRC, database, XMPP and git servers.


Thanks for reading! I'm also available on [gopher](gopher://sdf.org/1/users/katsuragi/)
